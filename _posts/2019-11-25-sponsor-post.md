This is a test post to demonstrate how the `post_notice_bottom` slot works. It's activated in `_config.yaml` and allows to insert custom content under each post. In this case, we have created a "Thank You" message for our supporters and a `sponsor` slot defined in the front-matter, which then will show on this post in perpetuity.
